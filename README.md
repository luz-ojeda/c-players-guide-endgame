# The Endgame
Final project of the [C# Player's Guide book](https://csharpplayersguide.com/).

Credits to [dotnet-console-games](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-console-games) for the `BlazorConsole.cs` class which implements the interactive console in the web.

The application is a console role-playing game where the player fights several battles until the last one against The Uncoded One, the final boss. Supports different possible actions such as attacking, using items, doing nothing, etc.

Game's logic resides inside the `./Game` folder.
